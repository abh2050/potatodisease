# TensorFlow Image Classification Project

This repository contains code for building and training an image classification model using TensorFlow. It demonstrates the process of loading a dataset, preprocessing images, building a convolutional neural network, and evaluating its performance.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow library
- Matplotlib library
- NumPy library

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required dependencies:
   - TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow`
   - Matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`
   - NumPy: `pip install numpy`

## Project Structure

- `image_classification.py`: Main Python script with the TensorFlow model and training process.
- `dataset/`: Directory containing the PlantVillage dataset.
- `models/`: Directory where the trained model will be saved.

## Usage

1. Run the `image_classification.py` script to start the training process.
2. The script will load the PlantVillage dataset, preprocess the images, and split them into training, validation, and test sets.
3. The convolutional neural network will be built and trained on the training set.
4. After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set.

## Customization

You can customize the following aspects of the project:

- **Dataset**: Replace the PlantVillage dataset with your dataset of choice.
- **Model Architecture**: Modify the convolutional neural network layers and parameters in the `image_classification.py` file.
- **Hyperparameters**: Adjust constants like `IMAGE_SIZE`, `BATCH_SIZE`, and `EPOCS` as per your requirement.
